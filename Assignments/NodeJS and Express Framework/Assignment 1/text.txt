I really became a robot,” a manager at an accounting firm explained. She and her colleagues worked 
extraordinarily long hours, but, she said, “I thought it was normal. It’s like brainwashing. You 
are in a kind of mental system where you are under increasing demands, and you say to yourself that
sit doesn’t matter, that you will rest afterwards, but that moment never comes.”

Through my research, I’ve heard stories like this over and over again from people in accounting firms,
law firms, consulting firms, and other white-collar jobs. We all know that chronic overwork is bad 
for our mental and physical health and can seriously jeopardize the quality of our work. We wish we
could change the way we work, but we don’t really know how.
